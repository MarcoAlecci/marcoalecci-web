abstract: Search engines are the easiest way to find the information that we need in our daily life, and they have became more and more powerful in the last years. Anyway, they are still far from perfection, and some problems afflict also the more advanced search engines. In this paper we discuss our approach to the problem of argument retrieval documenting our participation to the CLEF 2021 Touch√© Task 1. In particular, we present our IR system for the args. me corpus, a collection of documents extracted from web debate portals. After a pre-processing phase of the documents, we tried to use different methods like query expansion and re-ranking based on sentiment analysis. In the final part we report the results of our experiments and discuss about them and about other possible strategies that can be applied in the future.
